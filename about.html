            <h1> About Me</h1>
            <p>
                With an education consisting mostly of game development, my professional skills reflect this. I have several years of experience with C#, a year of experience with Java, and I'm currently learning HTML/Javascript/Ruby. Outside of education, I like all kinds of games, including board games such as Settlers of Catan, card games like Yu-Gi-Oh and
                Magic The Gathering, and Video Games such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
                I love tinkering with different ideas to see how they work, and I can guarantee I'll get excited for any idea you give to me.
                One of my passion projects involves creating a Discord bot for a small community that's used semi regularly, including an sql database for daily coins/interaction. I enjoy building computers, having built the last three I own, and several for friends and family.
