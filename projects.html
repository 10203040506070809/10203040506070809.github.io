            <h3> What was it? </h3>
            <p> The Damp and Mould application was a project developed within the Unity engine, given to us by Plymouth Energy Community, in order to make it easier to get information to homeowners who may be struggling with damp and mould within their home. It was meant to be used as an aid while visiting these people, who may learn better from a visual representation of the issues that their actions or inactions may cause. Colours and fonts were reused from the clients own website, to provide a fluid and consistent approach.</p>

            <h3> What was it? </h3>
            <p> An endless runner developed in 3 months as my first introduction to 3D game development within the Unity Engine. It featured endless gameplay, getting progressively more difficult, persistent data storage and a set of cars with different character stats. </p>
