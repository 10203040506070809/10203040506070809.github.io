                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Jack Fletcher! This site's currently in progress, as I'm learning full-stack development through the Odin Project and Freecodecamp. I'm a third-year student at Plymouth University, Devon studying Computing & Games Development. I've recently created projects such as <a href="projects.html#Dhelve"> Dhelve</a>,
                    a procedurally generated dungeon crawler, <a href="projects.html#Highway_Hero"> Highway Hero</a>, an endless runner, and have done client work for <a href="projects.html#PEC_App"> Plymouth Energy Community</a>
                </p>
                <br />

                        <li> UI Design and creation within the Unity Game Engine</li>

                        <li> Code Review for the team using Git</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3> What was it? </h3>
                    <p> The Damp and Mould application was a project developed within the Unity engine, given to us by Plymouth Energy Community, in order to make it easier to get information to homeowners who may be struggling with damp and mould within their home. It was meant to be used as an aid while visiting these people, who may learn better from a visual representation of the issues that their actions or inactions may cause. Colours and fonts were reused from the clients own website, to provide a fluid and consistent approach.</p>

                    <h3> What was it? </h3>
                    <p> An endless runner developed in 3 months as my first introduction to 3D game development within the Unity Engine. It featured endless gameplay, getting progressively more difficult, persistent data storage and a set of cars with different character stats. </p>

                    <p>
                        With an education consisting mostly of game development, my professional skills reflect this. I have several years of experience with C#, a year of experience with Java, and I'm currently learning HTML/Javascript/Ruby. Outside of education, I like all kinds of games, including board games such as Settlers of Catan, card games like Yu-Gi-Oh and
                        Magic The Gathering, and Video Games such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
                        I love tinkering with different ideas to see how they work, and I can guarantee I'll get excited for any idea you give to me.
                        One of my passion projects involves creating a Discord bot for a small community that's used semi regularly, including an sql database for daily coins/interaction. I enjoy building computers, having built the last three I own, and several for friends and family.
